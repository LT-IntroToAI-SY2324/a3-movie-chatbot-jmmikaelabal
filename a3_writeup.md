# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search_pa_list is a function that takes an input and finds a match in the database, outputting the corrsponding action. If is finds a match but has no answers, it will return no answers; if it finds no match it returns i don't understand.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
The movie that I added to the movies.py file was Halloween by John Carpenter. It was made in 1978 and the reason why I added the movie is because it is a classic and Halloween is coming up!

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added str.split("what is the best selling movie made by %"), title_by_director). This might be a useful pattern because it can find the top selling movie made by a certain director

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a music chatbot. It would generate different songs based on genre and artist and maybe even mood. I would create it so people can access and find songs depending on their input.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
Knowing what variables and functions to use throughout the code and having them match up so there wouldn't be any errors in code.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
yes I did
